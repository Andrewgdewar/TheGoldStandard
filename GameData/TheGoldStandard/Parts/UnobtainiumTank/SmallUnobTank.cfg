	description = A lead lined tank used to hold the extremely rare resource Unobtainium. The designers theorize that it will protect against the harmful radiation emitted by the substance; but, as Unobtainium has yet to be found or studied, they refuse to provide a refund if your crew's skin changes to bright beige.
